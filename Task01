Create a Synthetic Dataset:

Generate a dataset with random values for X and a linear relationship for y with added noise.
Combine X and y into a pandas DataFrame.

Split the Data:

Use train_test_split to divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Train the Model:

Create a linear regression model using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.
Fit the model to the training data.

Evaluate the Model:

Make predictions on both training and testing sets.
Calculate and print the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared values for both sets.

Visualize the Results:

Plot the regression line along with training and testing data points.
